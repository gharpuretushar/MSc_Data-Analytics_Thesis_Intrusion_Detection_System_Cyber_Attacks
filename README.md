# MSc_Data-Analytics_Thesis_Intrusion_Detection_System_Cyber_Attacks
This project builds an IoT Intrusion Detection System using deep learning to classify attacks like DoS, DDoS, BruteForce, Scan, and Web-based. After merging packet and flow data, we clean, engineer features, select top ones via Random Forest, and balance classes with SMOTE. CNN, LSTM, and Conv-LSTM are compared, with Conv-LSTM chosen for deployment

üéØ Objectives
Build a robust IDS for IoT traffic using real-world datasets.
Merge packet and flow data for richer feature representation.
Apply feature selection and SMOTE balancing to improve accuracy.
Compare CNN, LSTM, and Conv-LSTM for multi-class classification.
Save the best model for deployment in a web application.

üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of packet-level and flow-level CSV files for multiple attack categories:
DoS-HTTP Flood
DDoS-ACK Fragmentation
Dictionary BruteForce
Vulnerability Scan
Web-based Uploading Attacks
Benign Traffic

Each record includes network-level features such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, packet sizes, and timestamps.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn

Feature Engineering: scikit-learn, LabelEncoder

Balancing: imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

Models: TensorFlow, Keras

Model Evaluation: scikit-learn metrics, confusion matrix, classification report

‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow
Data Loading & Merging ‚Äì Merge packet and flow CSVs per attack type.

Data Cleaning ‚Äì Remove duplicates, drop high-missing-value columns, fill NaNs with medians.

Feature Engineering ‚Äì Extract temporal features (hour, day, weekend flag), encode categorical features, and select top features using Random Forest importance.

Class Balancing ‚Äì Apply SMOTE to handle class imbalance.

Data Splitting & Scaling ‚Äì Train-test split with StandardScaler for numeric features.

Model Training ‚Äì Build and train CNN, LSTM, and Conv-LSTM with EarlyStopping.

Model Evaluation ‚Äì Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, loss curves, and confusion matrices.

Model Saving ‚Äì Save best Conv-LSTM model (conv_lstm_model.keras) and scaler (scaler.pkl).

üìä Results Summary
CNN Accuracy: ~98%

LSTM Accuracy: ~98%

Conv-LSTM Accuracy: ~99.5% (Selected for deployment)

Conv-LSTM showed best generalization, minimal loss, and strong multi-class performance.
